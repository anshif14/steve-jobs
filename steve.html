    <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American entrepreneur, <br>
        industrial designer, business magnate, media proprietor,<br>
         and investor. He was the co-founder, the chairman, 
         and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority
         <br>shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar;
          and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. <br> He is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s,<br> 
          along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

    <p>Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and a German-American mother. 
        He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year.
         In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. 
         He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.
          A year later, the duo gained fame and wealth with production and sale of the Apple II,
           one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. 
           Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI).
            This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984,
             the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with
              the addition of the Apple LaserWriter,
         the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.</p>
         <p>In 1985, Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley.
             That same year, Jobs took a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized
              in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he
               funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the
                first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and went on to become a major animation studio, producing over 
                25 films since.</p>
                <p>In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT.
                     He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy.
                      He worked closely with English designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that 
                      had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the "Think different" advertising 
                      campaign and leading to the Apple Store, App Store, iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes,
                       and iTunes Store. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with the completely new Mac OS X (now known as macOS),
                        based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the operating system a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time.
                         In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of respiratory arrest 
                         related to the tumor on October 5, 2011 at the age of 56.</p>

                         <h2>Background</h2>
                         <h3>Biological and adoptive families</h3>
                         <p>Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955,
                             the son of Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي).
                              He was adopted by Clara (née Hagopian) and Paul Reinhold Jobs.[2]</p>
                              <p>Jandali, Jobs' biological father, was Syrian and went by the name "John".
                                 He grew up in an Arab Muslim household in Homs, Syria.[3]
                                  While an undergraduate at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, 
                                  he was a student activist and spent time in prison for his political activities.[3]
                                   He pursued a PhD at the University of Wisconsin, where he met Schieble, 
                                   an American Catholic of German and Swiss descent.[3][4] As a doctoral candidate,
                                    Jandali was a teaching assistant for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age.
                                    [5] Novelist Mona Simpson, Jobs' biological sister, noted that Schieble's parents were not happy that their daughter was dating a Muslim.
                                    [6] Walter Isaacson, author of the biography Steve Jobs, additionally states that Schieble's father 
                                    "threatened to cut her off completely" if she continued the relationship.[4]</p>
                                <p>Jobs' adoptive father was a Coast Guard mechanic.[7] After leaving the Coast Guard, he married Hagopian,
                                     an American of Armenian descent, in 1946.[8] Their attempts to start a family were
                                      halted after Hagopian had an ectopic pregnancy, leading them to consider adoption
                                       in 1955.[7][8][9] Hagopian's parents were survivors of the Armenian genocide.[10]</p>    
                                       <h3>Birth and early life</h3>
                                       <p>Schieble became pregnant with Jobs in 1954, when she and Jandali spent the summer with his family in Homs.
                                         According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: "Without telling me
                                         , Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me."[12]</p>
                                         <p>Schieble gave birth to Jobs in San Francisco on February 24, 1955, and chose an adoptive couple for 
                                            him that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy",[13][14] but the couple later changed their mind.
                                            [13] Jobs was then placed with Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education,
                                             and Schieble refused to sign the adoption papers.[15] She then took the matter to court in an attempt
                                              to have her baby placed with a different family,[13] and only consented to releasing the baby to Paul 
                                              and Clara after the couple pledged to pay for the boy's college education.[16] Jobs' 
                                            cousin, Bassma Al Jandaly, maintains that Jobs' birth name was Abdul Lateef Jandali.[17]</p>
                                            <p>Schieble gave birth to Jobs in San Francisco on February 24, 1955, and chose an adoptive couple for
                                                 him that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy",[13][14] but the couple later changed their 
                                                 mind.[13] Jobs was then placed with Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education,

                                                        <p>Paul and Clara adopted Jobs' sister Patricia in 1957[23] and by 1959 the
                                                             family had moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California.[24]
                                                              It was during this time that Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in 
                                                              order to "pass along his love of mechanics."[25] Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's c
                                                              raftsmanship "because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. 
                                                              When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... 
                                                              but I was eager to hang out with my dad."[25] By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics
                                                               and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood.[26][page needed] He had difficulty making 
                                                               friends with children his own age,
                                                             however, and was seen by his classmates as a "loner."[26][page needed]</p>
    <p>Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved, a
        nd was suspended a few times.[26][page needed] Clara had taught him to read as a toddler, and Jobs stated that he was "
        pretty bored in school and [had] turned into a little terror... you should have seen us in the third grade, we basically
         destroyed the teacher."[26][page needed] He frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary School in Mountain 
         View.[28] His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded him, 
        however, and instead blamed the school for not challenging his brilliant son.[28]</p>
        <p>Jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene "Teddy" Hill, with turning him around: 
            "She taught an advanced fourth grade class and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation.
             She bribed me into learning. She would say, 'I really want you to finish this workbook. 
             I'll give you five bucks if you finish it.' That really kindled a passion in me for learning things!
              I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school. They wanted me to skip
               the next two years in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my
                parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen."[26][page needed] Jobs skipped the 5th grade 
                and transferred to the 6th grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View[26][page needed] 
                where he became a "socially awkward loner".[29] Jobs was often "bullied" at Crittenden Middle, 
                and in the middle of 7th grade, he gave his parents an ultimatum: 
            they had to either take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.[30]</p>
